# SumsOfPowers

Mathematical paper on summations of first n powers of k via polynomial interpolation, with a proof of concept program.

Change the value of k in the main() function to calculate the formula for the sum of the first n powers of k. Explanation of how the program works along with proofs of any assertions made are available in the attached paper.

To Do:
- Fix minor typos and formatting
- Expand on proof of proposition 4.1
